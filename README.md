# APIWatchtower

**APIWatchtower** is an AI-powered agent for enterprises to monitor, detect, and respond to API failures and schema changes _before_ they break critical data pipelines or reports.

---

## üöÄ Overview

APIWatchtower enables organizations to proactively monitor their API endpoints, detect failures or breaking changes in real time, and receive intelligent alerts with actionable recommendations. Leveraging the power of modern LLMs, APIWatchtower not only flags issues but also explains the root cause and suggests remediation steps.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **API Endpoint Monitoring:** Register any API endpoint (REST, GraphQL, etc.) with customizable health checks.
- **Failure & Anomaly Detection:** Detects timeouts, error spikes, schema drift, and breaking changes.
- **AI-Powered Explanations:** Uses LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) to generate human-readable issue summaries and code suggestions.
- **Instant Alerts:** Get notified via Slack, Email, Webhooks, or Teams.
- **Visual Dashboard:** Track historical uptime, downtime, and change events.
- **Custom Assertions:** Define and enforce your own data invariants.

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **Worker/Queue:** pgqueuer (PostgreSQL-backed job queue for background tasks & scheduled checks)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (logs, configs, endpoints, and job queue)
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini APIs
- **Frontend:** Nextjs, React (planned) or Streamlit (for MVP)
